## What is TarotAI?

TarotAI is a modern, AI-powered system that combines traditional tarot reading with cutting-edge artificial intelligence. It's like having a tarot reader, a historian, and a data scientist all in one!

### Key Features:
- 🃏 AI-enhanced card interpretations
- 🌟 Multiple spread types (Single, Three Card, Celtic Cross)
- 🔮 Context-aware readings
- 📜 Reading history and pattern analysis
- 🎙️ Voice interface support
- 🕯️ Golden Dawn tradition integration

## How Does It Work?

Imagine you're asking a question to a very knowledgeable friend. TarotAI works similarly, but with some special AI magic:

1. **You Ask a Question**: 
   - "What should I focus on in my career?"
   - "What's coming up in my relationships?"

2. **The System Draws Cards**:
   - It shuffles a virtual deck and draws cards based on your question

3. **AI Interprets the Cards**:
   - Using advanced AI models, it analyzes the cards and their positions
   - It considers the traditional meanings plus modern insights

4. **Provides a Reading**:
   - Gives you a detailed interpretation
   - Offers practical advice and insights

## The Technology Behind TarotAI

### 1. AI Models (The Brain)
- **DeepSeek**: Our primary AI for understanding card meanings
- **VoyageAI**: Helps with finding connections between concepts
- **Claude**: Assists with structured responses and explanations

### 2. Embeddings (The Memory)
- Think of embeddings as a way to store the "essence" of each card
- They help the system understand relationships between cards
- Example: The "Lovers" card might be connected to "relationships" and "choices"

### 3. RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation (The Knowledge)
- Combines traditional tarot knowledge with modern AI
- Like having a library that instantly finds relevant information
- Ensures readings are both traditional and up-to-date

### 4. Python (The Foundation)
- The programming language that ties everything together
- Makes all the components work seamlessly
- Allows for easy updates and improvements

## Why This is Cool

1. **AI Collaboration**:
   - The entire system was built with AI assistance
   - I guided the AI to create this complex system
   - It's like having a super-smart coding partner!

2. **Modern Meets Traditional**:
   - Combines centuries-old wisdom with cutting-edge tech
   - Makes tarot more accessible and insightful

3. **Always Learning**:
   - The system gets better with each reading
   - It learns from patterns and user feedback

## How to Use TarotAI

1. **Ask a Question**:
   - Think about what you want guidance on
   - Be specific for better results

2. **Choose a Spread**:
   - Single card for quick insights
   - Three card for past/present/future
   - Celtic Cross for detailed readings

3. **Get Your Reading**:
   - The system will draw cards and provide an interpretation
   - You'll get both traditional meanings and modern insights

4. **Explore Further**:
   - Save your reading to track patterns over time
   - Compare with previous readings
   - Get additional insights from the system

## Example Reading

```plaintext
